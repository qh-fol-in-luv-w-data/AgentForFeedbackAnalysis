With its shooting buzz saws, collapsing cliffs, and other shenanigans, this is my go-to game for when I’m bored, sad, or if I just need some trolling fun. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the graphics are simple yet perfect. Definitely add more levels to the game! +*+*+*+Suggestions:+*+*+*+ -Add a hard level of the day that changes each time. -Maybe turn down the ads a little bit. I know you have to make money, but you could make people watch an ad to play the level of the day(see above). I am SO GLAD I stumbled upon this gem of a game hidden in a cave of boring rocks. Thank you, Unept!! Bye, DoggyDonuts",
